# DIFM-ModLoader
ModLoader for Do It For Me Speedrun Mod

# Usage:
 - Place the .exe file into the same directory as the DIFM executable.
 - Either double click the .exe, or run it from command line.
 - It will ask for the version, either enter a version number, eg 1.0.1, or enter latest/newest. The version number is self-explanatory, newest or latest gives the latest version of the file, even if it hasn't been released.
 - If you ran it from command line, and get the message `Something went wrong`, please make sure you typed everythign correctly.

# Known issues
 - If you get a Windows Defender pop-up, don't worry, this isn't a virus. Just press `more info -> run anyway` and it should run.
 - v1.0 doesn't seem to work  --- I am attempting to get this to work, it's a weird issue as the mod is still downloaded and patched.
